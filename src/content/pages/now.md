## What I'm Doing Now üõ†Ô∏è

This is my "now" page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about). A "now" page is a snapshot of your current focus and activities. It's more than just a status update ‚Äî it's a public declaration of your priorities and values. If you have a personal site, consider adding one! It serves as both a personal compass and a way to share your journey with others.

### What am I upto? ü¶Ñ

- Building secure and scalable tech at [GSK](https://gsk.com).
- Developing [Jaro](https://jaroli.me), my long-awaited project.
- Updating this site, [jaro.li](https://jaro.li).
- Working on my tech agency and contract projects on the weekend.
- Pushing my side projects to GitHub.
- Improving my backend arc, mostly with Golang.
- On the side, exploring System Design, Rust, Security, and Cloud at scale.

### Some goals I've set for myself ü•Ö

- Create something that addresses a genuine problem. It need not be a SaaS, not even remotely tech-related, but something that adds value to every soul involved in the process, from creation to utilization, of that <i>something</i>. 
- Be an engineer at heart. Asking more why(s) behind everything. 
- Elevate my expertise in backend engineering at scale.<br><br><br>



<i><b>Balance</b> is the key to everything.</i>
