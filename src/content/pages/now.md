This is my "now" page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about). A "now" page is a snapshot of your current focus and priorities.

### What am I upto?

- Leading an AI project for the Cyber Security function at [GSK](https://gsk.com).
- Building [Jaro Labs](https://jarolabs.com), my tech studio, slowly and tastefully.
- Contributing to open-source. Currently, [FlexPrice](https://github.com/flexprice).
- Dabbling with robots and hardware. I've always been fascinated with deep tech and this is exactly what I plan to do with Jaro Labs.

### Some goals I've set for myself

- Create something that addresses a genuine problem. It need not be a SaaS, not even remotely tech-related, but something that adds value to every soul involved in the process, from creation to utilization, of that <i>something</i>. 
- Be an engineer at heart. Asking more why(s) behind everything. 
- Embrace the <i>[leve-leve](https://medium.com/gain-indpiration/the-leve-leve-lifestyle-of-s%C3%A3o-tom%C3%A9-and-pr%C3%ADncipe-f5f9f6712289)</i> lifestyle.<br><br><br>



<b>Balance</b> is the key to everything.
