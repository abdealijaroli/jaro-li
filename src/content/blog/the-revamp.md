But Abdeali, why? Why the revamp? Why the change?

A breath of fresh air. I wanted something minimal, clean and simple. I wanted something that was easy to navigate and easy to read. I wanted something that was easy to maintain and update.

I wanted something less cluttered. Probably, less JavaScript-y?

But moreover, I am planning a lot of things, which will require a lot of jotting down. For memories? You'd ask.

I'd say, yes. All hail my digital garden of memories.
